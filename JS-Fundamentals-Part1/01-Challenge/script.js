/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index),
which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meters).

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:
Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.
*/

const massMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;
const massJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;

const BMIMark = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark);
const BMIJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);

console.log(BMIMark, BMIJohn);

const markHigherBMI = BMIMark > BMIJohn;
console.log(markHigherBMI);

/*
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

Print a nice output to the console, telling the user who has the higher BMI. The message can be either:
"Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!".
 */
if (BMIMark > BMIJohn) {
  console.log(`Mark's BMI (${BMIMark}) is higher than John's (${BMIJohn})!`);
} else {
  console.log(`John's BMI (${BMIJohn}) is higher than Mark's (${BMIMark})!`);
}
